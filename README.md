# Cell-Counting
Trying to characterize and count cells with python

Does with it says on the tin. Also fits ellipses to the resulting cells and includes a rough goodness of fit parameter. 
Too many free parameters for my liking at the moment, but does okay-ish in most cases. Tends to fail when many cells are bunched together.
